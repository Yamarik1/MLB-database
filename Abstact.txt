This project was completed as part of the database course that I took in collage
The point of this project was to apply all of the concepts learned throughout the year into a final project. The students were able to choose the data set we worked 
with, so I decided to use MLB players, since baseball has alot of data and stats.
This first part of the project was populating the data, and giving the user the ability to search the info on teams, divisons, and stats of individual players. The 
second part was to allow the user to update the data in the form of an At Bat. The result of an At Bat can be provided, and all of the neccesary information will be 
updated. Baseball has a lot of information that is derived from other stats, so this feature only needs the needed information in order to update all the info in the 
database.
